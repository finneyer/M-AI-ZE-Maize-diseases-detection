    "- **Automated training** across different YOLO variants (`n`, `m`, `l`), batch sizes, and splits.\n",
    "- Support for:\n",
    "  - `SID02` subtype-specific training (`boom`, `drone`, `handheld`)\n",
    "  - `SID03` K-Fold cross-validation.\n",
    "- **Custom evaluation using the RAAD metric** (Relative Affected Area Difference), assessing bounding box area agreement between predictions and ground truth.\n",
    "- **Integration with Weights & Biases (wandb)** for:\n",
    "  - Tracking training runs and hyperparameters.\n",
    "  - Logging test metrics and qualitative predictions.\n",
